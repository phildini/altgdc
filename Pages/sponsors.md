# Sponsoring altGDC

Thank you for your interest in sponsoring altGDC!

We are committed to keeping altGDC free, so as to not add to the financial burden of those who are in San Francisco because of nonrefundable travel plans. Your funding helps make sure that we can still have an inclusive, enjoyable, and safe event!

Several different sponsorship levels are available. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact us directly](mailto:altgdc@lazerwalker.com).

## SPONSOR A CONFERENCE ELEMENT

Sponsoring a specific element of the conference can be a particularly great way to stand out in the eyes of attendees! [Send us an email](mailto:altgdc@lazerwalker.com) if you're interested in sponsoring a particular conference element.

### Live Captioning and Transcriptions

One concrete way altGDC aims to be radically inclusive is by hiring a human captioner to provide real-time transcriptions, both for in-person attendees and the livestream. We find this is useful for everyone, not just those who are deaf or heard of hearing, and makes it easier for everyone to engage with presentations.

After the conference concludes, we'll have these transcripts cleaned up, so that people will be able to benefit from high-quality captions anywhere the videos are posted. Sponsoring our captions is a fantastic (and very visible) way to show your company cares about accessibility!

### A Meal

San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the world, and most of our attendees will already be hurting financially from their nonrefundable travel plans.

Providing breakfast, lunch, or a snack break is a great way to win the minds, hearts, and stomachs of independent game developers everywhere.

### ...something else?

If you have other ideas, we’d love to hear about them and work with you – feel free to [contact us](mailto:altgdc@lazerwalker.com)!

## A note about budget surplus

This conference is being thrown together very last-minute, so it is difficult for us to exactly anticipate budgetary needs.

If we end up raising more in sponsorship funds than we strictly need to cover this year's conference costs, all surplus funds will go towards a pre-existing non-profit endeavor (TBD) to help provide relief for indie game developers financially impacted by GDC's cancellation/postponement.
