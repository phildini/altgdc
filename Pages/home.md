# altGDC is happening

altGDC is a three day conference about game design and development happening in San Francisco during the week that that other conference was supposed to be running. We'll be providing a single speaking track for GDC speakers (and potentially other speakers!) to give their talks as planned, as well as a space to network, learn, and commiserate on the games industry.

Our goals are twofold:

1. Provide a space for the members of the community who were unable to cancel travel plans for the week of GDC — or are normally based in the Bay Area — to share knowledge, network, and hang out in a friendly social setting.

2. Bridge the gap between in-person and virtual GDC events by providing GDC speakers (and others) the chance to have their talks professionally recorded, captioned, and live-streamed. As a speaker, you'll leave altGDC with a high-quality video of your talk, with professional captions, suitable to send to the GDC Vault, the [#notGDC](http://notgdc.fun) non-conference, or any other place you might want to use it.

We are currently lining up our speakers and venue. Please use the forms below if you’re interested in learning more, and you can also follow us at [@altGDConf](https://twitter.com/altgdconf) for general updates.

# FAQ

## Who's putting this thing on?

Right now, the organizing team is [Em Lazer-Walker](https://twitter.com/lazerwalker), [Andrew Cedotal](https://andrewcedotal.com/), and [Phildini James](https://twitter.com/phildini). Between them they have over a decade of experience in the games industry, and nearly that much experience putting on conferences. Em and Philip are also two of the core organizers of the [Roguelike Celebration](https://roguelike.club) conference.

## Is this affiliated with the conference that got moved?

No, we're doing this on our own, for the community of folks that will still be here during that week.

## Isn't it dangerous to do this, what with the COVID-19 thing?

The way things stand on the ground in San Francisco today, we still think this is doable in a safe way. We will take all the precautions we can with the event, and if the situation in SF gets to the point where they're advising people to stay in their homes, we will adjust our plans accordingly. We can't guarantee this will happen, but we're going to try hard to make it happen.

To reiterate: this is an event intended to try to make the best of an unfortunate situation. We'd recommend you not actively travel to SF just to participate if you're not already based here or have the ability to get a full or partial refund on your travel plans. Additionally, if you are immunocompromised or live with/have close contact with anyone is immunocompromised, or are traveling from abroad and have concerns about American health care, _please_ check in with your doctor about any concerns you might have. The risk of COVID-19 might relatively low for the general population right now, but we hope you'll make the decision that is best not just for you, but for your home community and the community here in San Francisco.
