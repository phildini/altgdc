# altGDC is happening

Hello! First of all: **altGDC is happening.**

The organizing team has spent the past week talking to potential venues, sponsors, and speakers for an event that matches our goals. Our goals with altGDC are to:  

1.  Provide a space for the indie game community to share knowledge, network, and hang out in a welcoming social setting.
    
2.  Live-stream and record talks so that GDC speakers can still reach their audience, and their audience can still benefit from their insights. 
    
The continued industry response to COVID-19 has made our original plan, to host an in-person conference for about 150 of you amazing people, difficult. Here’s what our current plan is:

*   The altGDC talk track is going to be streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/altgdc), but will not have a physical presence for non-speakers. For speakers who will still be in San Francisco, we’ll be providing a semi-professional video recording studio you can use.
    
*   The altGDC hallway track will be a mixture of [Discord chat channels](https://discordapp.com/invite/Nr9QQk2), Discord voice channels, and the Twitch chat. We’re going to find ways to make it feel as close to in-person as possible, including having speaker drop-ins and organizing special virtual events. We’ll also share information about altGDC watch parties as we hear of them.
    
*   The altGDC party track will happen in the evenings with all the parties we can find or throw, and we’ll be sending out more details as they emerge.

While this isn’t everything that we originally hoped for, we’re still committed to hosting the best event we can, and we hope you’ll join us.

# FAQ

## Who's putting this thing on?

Right now, the organizing team is [Em Lazer-Walker](https://twitter.com/lazerwalker), [Andrew Cedotal](https://andrewcedotal.com/), [Phildini James](https://twitter.com/phildini), and [Ben McGraw](https://twitter.com/bengrue).

## Is this affiliated with the conference that got moved?

No, we're doing this on our own, for the community of folks that will still be here during that week.

## Do you have a Code of Conduct?

We're so glad you asked! We are very dedicated to providing a safe and welcoming safe space for all. You can read our code of conduct [here](https://altgdc.com/coc)

## This doesn't exactly sound like my jam, what else should I check out?

## Isn't it dangerous to do this, what with the COVID-19 thing?

The way things stand on the ground in San Francisco today, we still think this is doable in a safe way. We will take all the precautions we can with the event, and if the situation in SF gets to the point where they're advising people to stay in their homes, we will adjust our plans accordingly. We can't guarantee this will happen, but we're going to try hard to make it happen.

**To reiterate**: this is an event intended to make the best of an unfortunate situation. Do not plan to attend if:

- You've already cancelled your GDC plans

- You are immunocompromised, or live with / have close contact with someone who is immunocompromised

- You are traveling from abroad and have concerns about US health care, or are otherwise concerned about travel in any way

If in doubt, _please_ check in with your doctor. We hope you’ll make the decision that is best not just for you, but for your home community and the community here in San Francisco.
