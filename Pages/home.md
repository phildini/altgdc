# altGDC is happening

altGDC is a three day conference about game design and development happening in San Francisco during the week that that other conference was supposed to be running. We're going to put on a three-day event featuring as many of the original talks that we can find, as well as space to network, learn, and commiserate on the games industry.

# FAQ

## Who's putting this thing on?
Right now, the organizing team is [Em Lazer-Walker](https://lazerwalker.com/), [Andrew Cedotal](https://andrewcedotal.com/), and [Phildini James](https://twitter.com/phildini). Between them they have over a decade of experience in the games industry, and nearly that much experience putting on conferences. Em and Philip are part of the roguelike celebration organizers.

## Is this affiliated with the conference that got moved?
No, we're doing this on our own, for the community of folks that will still be here during that week.

## Isn't it dangerous to do this, what with the COVID-19 thing?
The way things stand on the ground in San Francisco today, we still think this is doable in a safe way. We will take all the precautions we can with the event, and if the situation in SF gets to the point where they're advising people to stay in their homes, we will adjust our plans accordingly. We can't guarantee this will happen, but we're going to try hard to make it happen.
